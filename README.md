# Lobu On React Starter
Starter/seed project for MongoDB, Koa, React/Redux, Node full-stack JavaScript apps.

## Usage
Clone the starter onto your machine and install all of the dependencies. You may need to [install a local copy of mongodb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) if you do not already have it.


```
git clone https://github.com/gottliebtj/reactLobu
cd mkrn-starter/api
npm install
cd ../mkrn-starter/app
npm install
```
Now, you need to set up three shells to run mongodb, the server, and the client.

*shell 1 - this is mongodb*

```
cd ../mkrn-starter/app
mongo
```
*shell 2 - this is the server*

```
cd ../mkrn-starter/app
npm start
```
*shell 3 - this is your client*

```
cd ../mkrn-starter/api
npm start
```

At this point, you should be able to navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` on your browser (if it doesn't open automatically) and see the landing page. make an accont and login to view the /dashboard route.
